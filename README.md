# Annotation schemes of the WoPoss project

In this repo you can find:

- The description of the different layers of annotation of the WoPoss projects (as required in INCEpTION). This description is formalized in JSON and it includes the tagsets ([see layers](https://github.com/WoPoss/annotation-schemes/tree/master/layers)).

- The definition of the annotation constraints (as required in INCEpTION) ([see constraints](https://github.com/WoPoss/annotation-schemes/tree/master/constraints))

- An example of the WoPoss annotation to play around with in INCEpTION ([see demo](https://github.com/WoPoss/annotation-schemes/tree/master/demo)). The instructions are available [here](http://woposs.unil.ch/db.php).

- The TEI schemas (in progress):
	- [Feature system declaration](https://github.com/WoPoss-project/annotation-schemes/blob/master/schemas/fsDecl-to-Schematron.xsl) (and [XSLT file that transforms this declaration in Schematron rules](https://github.com/WoPoss-project/annotation-schemes/blob/master/schemas/fsDecl-to-Schematron.xsl))
	- ODD files: [main ODD file](https://github.com/WoPoss-project/annotation-schemes/blob/master/schemas/tei_woposs.odd) and [Gospels-specific file](https://github.com/WoPoss-project/annotation-schemes/blob/master/schemas/tei_woposs_gospels.odd)
 	- [RelaxNG files](https://github.com/WoPoss-project/annotation-schemes/tree/master/schemas/out)
